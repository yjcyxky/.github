### A platform for drug & biomarker screening

Such as Knowledge Graph, Omics Data Analyzer, QC Tools, Data Repo for BioMedical Models, DL Models etc.

|Title | Language | Description|
|--|--|--|
| [BioMedGPS Studio](https://github.com/yjcyxky/biomedgps-studio) | TypeScript | [Frontend] A knowledge graph system with graph neural network for drug discovery, disease mechanism and biomarker screening.|
| [Rapex](https://github.com/yjcyxky/rapex) | Clojure, Python | RAPEX - Response to Air Pollution EXposure |
| [Ontology Matcher](https://github.com/yjcyxky/ontology-matcher) | Python | It's a simple ontology matcher for building a set of cleaned ontologies. [For BioMedGPS project]|
| [Chat Publications](https://github.com/yjcyxky/chat-publications) | Python | Ask questions and get answers from publications.|
| [BioMiner Indexd](https://github.com/yjcyxky/biominer-indexd) | Rust | Index engine for biomedical data files. We epect it will be a indexing engine for indexing high quality data, such as clinical data (EHR), multi-omics data, whole slide image, etc. |
| [R Omics Utility](https://github.com/yjcyxky/r-omics-utils) | R | Utilities for omics data with R. It will be part of biomedgps system and provide visulization and analysis functions of multi-omics data. |
| [PreQC Pack](https://github.com/yjcyxky/preqc-pack) | Rust | A quality control tool for high throughput sequence data. |
| [BioMedical Knowledgebases](https://github.com/yjcyxky/biomedical-knowledgebases) | Markdown | A collection of biomedical knowledgebases, ontologies, datasets and publications etc. |
  
### Next Plans

#### Data Repo

- [ ] To build a online indexing system based on `BioMiner Indexd` for managing biomedical data, such as clinical data (EHR), multi-omics data, whole slide image, etc. [DEMO System](https://indexd.org/)

- [ ] To organize a team to keep curating biomedical data from public/private data repo, publications.

- [ ] To provide metadata validator for data curation.

#### Knowledge Graph

- [ ] To improve knowledge graph and related system. Expand ontologies, knowledges and train different deep-learning models for drug & biomarker screening.

- [ ] To provide a set of tools for building knowledge graph.

#### QC Tool

- [ ] To release QC tools for multi-omics data. [By Quartet Team, more details on Quartet Data Portal]
  
## Online System
|Title | Description |
|--|--|
| [Quartet Data Portal](https://www.chinese-quartet.org/#/dashboard) | The Quartet Project provides publicly accessible multi-omics reference materials and practical tools to enhance the reproducibility and reliability of multi-omics results. Well-characterized multiomics reference materials and quality control metrics pertinent to precision medicine study purposes can be used to measure and mitigate technical variation, enabling more accurate cross-batch and cross-omics data integration in increasingly large-scale and longitudinal studies such as the International Human Phenome Project.|

Such as Knowledge Graph, Omics Data Analyzer, QC Tools, Data Repo for BioMedical Models, DL Models etc.

|Title | Language | Description|
|--|--|--|
| [BioMedGPS](https://github.com/yjcyxky/biomedgps) | Rust, TypeScript, Python | A knowledge graph system with graph neural network for drug discovery, disease mechanism and biomarker screening.|
| [Chat Publications](https://github.com/yjcyxky/chat-publications) | Python | Ask questions and get answers from publications.|
| [BioMiner Indexd](https://github.com/yjcyxky/biominer-indexd) | Rust | Index engine for biomedical data files. We epect it will be a indexing engine for indexing high quality data, such as clinical data (EHR), multi-omics data, whole slide image, etc. |
| [PreQC Pack](https://github.com/yjcyxky/preqc-pack) | Rust | A quality control tool for high throughput sequence data. |
  
## Online System

|--|--|
| [Quartet Data Portal](https://www.chinese-quartet.org/#/dashboard) | The Quartet Project provides publicly accessible multi-omics reference materials and practical tools to enhance the reproducibility and reliability of multi-omics results. Well-characterized multiomics reference materials and quality control metrics pertinent to precision medicine study purposes can be used to measure and mitigate technical variation, enabling more accurate cross-batch and cross-omics data integration in increasingly large-scale and longitudinal studies such as the International Human Phenome Project.|
